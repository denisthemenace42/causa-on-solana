# Causa on Solana

**Causa on Solana** is more than just a token — it’s a movement.  
At its heart, the project exists to channel blockchain power into **good causes around the world**.  

Through a built-in tax system on transactions, a percentage of every trade goes directly to:  
- 🌍 **Charity & Donations** – managed transparently through a DAO and reputation-based governance.  
- 💰 **Reward Pool** – fueling the **Urna Vault**, where community members can claim direct SOL rewards .  

This dual system ensures that every interaction with the token is both:  
1. A **contribution to global good**.  
2. A **rewarding experience for holders**.

## Key Features

- 📱 **Mobile-first** – Built with React Native + Expo for Solana Mobile.
- 🌍 **Cause-driven Taxation** – Automatic % of each transaction goes to charity pools.
- 🗳️ **DAO + Reputation Points (RP)** – Users earn RP for actions (quests, donations, timing claims). RP grants governance rights and influence over which causes receive funding.  
- 💰 **Urna Vault Rewards** – Manual claiming of rewards funded by transaction tax allocations.  
- 🔒 **Staking with Multipliers** – Long-term holders receive boosted rewards.  
- ⭐ **Gamified Experience** – Quests, leaderboards, and reward timing create engagement beyond simple holding.
